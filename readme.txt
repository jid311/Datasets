Datasets for "Nonlocal low-rank constraint-based ESPIRiT parallel MRI reconstruction"


Dataset 1:
The file name is brain_alias_8ch.mat. The corresponding undersampling pattern (AF=5) is saved as mask_AF5_320x256.mat. The corresponding ROI mask is saved as maskroi_brain_alias_8ch.mat. You can download Dataset 1 at website: https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mlustig/software/SPIRiT_v0.3.tar.gz


Dataset 2: 
The file name is mprage_8ch_slice20_s14.mat. Dataset 2 is the 14th slice of mprage_8ch_slice20.mat. The corresponding undersampling pattern (AF=5) is saved as mask_AF5_256x256.mat. The corresponding ROI mask is saved as maskroi_mprage_8ch_slice20_s14.mat. We downloaded Dataset 2 on April 4, 2013 at website: http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~fhlin/codes/mprage_8ch_slice20.mat


Dataset 3: 
The file name is brain_chall_tr4_tran_95.mat. The corresponding undersampling pattern (AF=5) is saved as mask_AF5_218x170.mat. The corresponding ROI mask is saved as maskroi_brain_chall_tr4_tran_95.mat. We downloaded e14141s3_P58880.7.h5 on June 1, 2020 at website: https://sites.google.com/view/calgary-campinas-dataset/download, and then extracted its 95th transverse slice.
